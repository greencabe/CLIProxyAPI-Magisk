# CLIProxyAPI Magisk

ARM64 Android Magisk/KernelSU/Next SU module builder for
[CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI).

Author: Rofiq

This repository does not fork CLIProxyAPI source code. GitHub Actions checks
out an official upstream release, builds an Android-native ARM64 binary,
overlays the root-module packaging, bundles the management dashboard, and
publishes a traceable release archive.

## Requirements

- ARM64 (`arm64-v8a`) device.
- Android 7.0/API 24 or newer.
- A current Magisk, KernelSU, or Next SU manager.
- Installation through the root manager; custom-recovery installation is not
  supported or tested.

## Installation

1. Download `cliproxyapi-magisk.zip` and `checksums.txt` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/greencabe/CLIProxyAPI-Magisk/releases/latest).
2. Verify the download with `sha256sum -c checksums.txt` when that tool is
   available.
3. Install the ZIP from the module page in Magisk, KernelSU, or Next SU.
4. Reboot, then open the module action to inspect its health report.
5. Configure provider credentials with the optional Termux wrapper or edit
   `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/config.yaml` as root.

## Security Defaults

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8317`, so an empty `api-keys` list is only
appropriate for on-device use. The management API remains disabled until a
management secret is configured. Never expose the default configuration to a
LAN or the internet.

## Secure LAN Access

Create a long, unique client key before changing the listener to `0.0.0.0`:

```yaml
host: "0.0.0.0"
port: 8317

api-keys:
  - "replace-with-a-long-random-client-key"

remote-management:
  allow-remote: false
  secret-key: "replace-with-a-different-long-random-management-key"
```

Restart the service after editing. Keep `allow-remote: false` unless remote
dashboard administration is explicitly required; API access over an untrusted
network should be protected by a firewall or an authenticated TLS tunnel.

## Dashboard

The bundled `management.html` supports an offline first run and the root
manager WebUI redirects to it. CLIProxyAPI requires
`remote-management.secret-key` even for local management requests, so set that
value before expecting dashboard controls to work.

## Runtime Behavior

- Starts CLIProxyAPI from the root manager's late-start service stage.
- Restarts a crashed process with bounded backoff to avoid a tight crash loop.
- Rejects stale PID files instead of signaling unrelated Android processes.
- Preserves configuration and provider authentication across module upgrades.
- Stores state outside the replaceable module directory in
  `/data/adb/cliproxyapi`.
- Serves the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8317` by default.

Disable autostart and stop the running service:

```sh
touch /data/adb/cliproxyapi/disable
```

Stop it for the current boot only:

```sh
touch /data/adb/cliproxyapi/stop
```

Start it again during the same boot:

```sh
rm -f /data/adb/cliproxyapi/disable /data/adb/cliproxyapi/stop
sh /data/adb/modules/cliproxyapi/service.sh
```

## Paths

- Config: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/config.yaml`
- Provider auth files: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/auths`
- App stdout/stderr: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/cliproxyapi.log`
- Rotating application logs: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/logs`
- Watchdog log: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/watchdog.log`
- Dashboard: `/data/adb/cliproxyapi/static/management.html`

## Termux CLI Wrapper

When Termux already exists, the installer adds a `cliproxyapi` wrapper that
forwards CLIProxyAPI arguments through `su` and supplies the module config by
default. An unrelated existing executable is not overwritten.

```sh
cliproxyapi -h
cliproxyapi -codex-login -no-browser
cliproxyapi -codex-device-login
cliproxyapi -claude-login -no-browser
```

## Uninstall and Credential Removal

Normal uninstall stops the service and removes the module-owned Termux wrapper,
but intentionally preserves `/data/adb/cliproxyapi` for later reinstall. That
directory contains configuration and provider tokens; permanently erase it
only when those credentials are no longer needed:

```sh
su -c 'rm -rf /data/adb/cliproxyapi'
```

## Release Flow

- A scheduled workflow checks the latest upstream CLIProxyAPI release at
  00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC every day.
- An existing published release and tag are never deleted or overwritten.
- Manual dispatch can build the latest release or a specific semantic tag.
- `versionCode` reserves its final two digits for immutable `r1`–`r99`
  packaging revisions, so subsequent upstream versions remain newer.
- Release notes record the CLIProxyAPI commit, model catalog commit, dashboard
  release, and dashboard digest used by the build.
- The release contains the module ZIP, SHA-256 checksum, and provenance; the
  ZIP itself includes the project license and third-party notices.

## Manual Build in Actions

Open **Actions → Release Magisk Module → Run workflow** and optionally provide
an upstream tag such as `v7.2.79`. If the upstream version was already
published, set `force=true` to create the first free immutable revision tag
from `v7.2.79-r1` through `v7.2.79-r99` rather than replacing the original.

## Local Build

Put build inputs here:

```text
packaging/magisk/bin/cli-proxy-api
packaging/magisk/static/management.html
```

Then run:

```sh
VERSION=v7.2.79 VERSION_CODE=700207900 ./packaging/magisk/build-module.sh
```

The resulting archive is `dist/magisk/cliproxyapi-magisk.zip`.

## Validation

Pull requests and pushes validate shell syntax, workflow syntax, module
metadata, executable permissions, archive contents, and Android ELF properties.
Device-level verification is still recommended when changing boot, SELinux, or
root-manager integration behavior.
